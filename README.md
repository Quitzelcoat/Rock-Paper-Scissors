# Rock-Paper-Scissors
## My first javascript program.
It was quite a tough one for the first time. It took me around 4 to 5 days which in between i had to get guidance and hints but eventually it got completed. But all in all it was worth the experience and i am excited for the future projects and problems i will have to solve.
